# Operation Scorpion Code Dump

This repo stores several legacy versions of Operation Scorpion, an FPS game on Roblox. This repo's main purpose is to provide code samples written by me. This repo is not for keeping track of any active development.

There are 3 three main code snapshots in this repo:

- 2017 pre alpha
- 2018 alpha
- late 2018 - 2019 beta

Other codes include:

- math notes (mostly Mathematica files)
- DataServer (postgreSQL and ExpressJS setup)
